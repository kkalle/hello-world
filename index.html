    <h1>Welcome to ShootingApp project!</h1>

    <p>
      ShootingApp is a going to be an application that lets you record and analyze your target shooting scores. The app is developed by hobbyists for their own and general use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app is going to have the following features:
      <ul>
        <li>Mobile app for recording scores and basic analysis</li>
        <li>Web application for deeper analysis</li>
        <li>A scoreboard for sharing records at different locations</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We plan to first implement the mobile app for iOS/iPhone and later release version for Android and Windows Phone.
